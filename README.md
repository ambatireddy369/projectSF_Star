## What a Skill Looks Like

Every skill is a structured guide an AI follows end-to-end. Example for `apex/trigger-framework`:

```
trigger-framework/
├── SKILL.md              ← the AI's instructions: modes, gather questions, step-by-step
├── references/
│   ├── examples.md       ← real code examples with test classes
│   ├── gotchas.md        ← non-obvious platform behaviors
│   └── well-architected.md  ← WAF pillar mapping + official sources
├── templates/
│   └── trigger-framework-template.md  ← deployable scaffold
└── scripts/
    └── check_trigger.py  ← local validator (stdlib only, no pip)
```

Skills are plain markdown. They work in any AI tool that can read a file.

## Using Skills in Practice

### Ask your AI to use a specific skill
```
"Use the trigger-framework skill to build an Account trigger handler"
"Follow the batch-apex-patterns skill to review this batch class"
"Apply the permission-set-architecture skill to this org assessment"
```

### Let the AI find the right skill
```
"My trigger is firing twice on the same record update"
→ AI searches, finds recursive-trigger-prevention skill, applies it

"Why can't my user see the field even though they have object access?"
→ AI searches, finds soql-security + permission-set-architecture, applies both
```

### Search skills yourself
```bash
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "my flow is hitting limits"
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "callout timeout" --domain integration
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "data skew performance" --domain data
```

---

## Request a Missing Skill

If you need a skill that doesn't exist yet:

**Option 1 — Tell the AI (Claude Code):**
```
/request-skill
```
The agent asks what you need, checks for existing coverage, and adds it to the build queue.

**Option 2 — Add directly to the queue:**
Open `MASTER_QUEUE.md` and add a row to the relevant section:
```markdown
| TODO | your-skill-name | What it does. NOT for what it doesn't cover. | |
```

**Option 3 — Open a GitHub issue:**
Title: `[Skill Request] <domain>: <skill-name>`
Body: describe the use case, the role, and what cloud it applies to.

---

## Contribute a Skill

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow.

The short version:
```bash
# 1. Check it doesn't already exist
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "<your topic>"

# 2. Scaffold it
python3 scripts/new_skill.py <domain> <skill-name>

# 3. Fill every TODO in the generated files

# 4. Sync and validate
python3 scripts/skill_sync.py --skill skills/<domain>/<skill-name>
python3 scripts/validate_repo.py

# 5. Open a PR
```

Every skill must pass two gates before merging:
- **Structural gate:** `validate_repo.py` exits 0
- **Quality gate:** `standards/skill-content-contract.md` — source grounding, content depth, agent usability, contradiction check, freshness

---

## Update an Existing Skill

Found something wrong? Source changed? Platform behavior updated?

```bash
# Edit the skill files
# Then:
python3 scripts/skill_sync.py --skill skills/<domain>/<skill-name>
python3 scripts/validate_repo.py
# Open a PR with what changed and why
```

Or tell the AI:
```
"The trigger-framework skill is missing guidance for the new Flow-triggered Apex pattern in Spring '25"
```
The Currency Monitor agent will handle it if you flag it during a release cycle.

Orchestrator Agent       ← routes tasks to the right builder
      │
      ├── Task Mapper         ← researches Cloud × Role task universes
      ├── Content Researcher  ← grounds every claim in official sources (Tier 1-3)
      ├── Admin Skill Builder ← builds Admin + BA skills

      ├── Currency Monitor    ← flags stale skills after each SF release
      └── Validator           ← structural + quality gates before every commit
```

Skills are grounded in a 4-tier source hierarchy:
- **Tier 1:** Official Salesforce docs (ground truth)
- **Tier 2:** Trailhead, Salesforce Architects blog, Salesforce Ben
- **Tier 3:** Andy in the Cloud, Apex Hours, Salesforce Stack Exchange
- **Tier 4:** Community signal (context only, never the basis for a claim)
